      <h2>hi there, this is Cristhian Cepeda</h2>
      <p>
        I write beautiful code and music. I have collaborated in dozens of
        projects with people of different countries, designing, developing
        interfaces and also making awesome music. I have worked in educational
        and entertainment ventures, and through creativity and genuine curiosity
        I create helpful and relevant experiences for the people.
